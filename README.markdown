# Judo

Judo is a tool for managing a cloud of ec2 servers.  It aims to be both simple
to get going and powerful.

## CONCEPTS

Servers and Groups.  Servers are identified by a naked string.  Groups always
have a colon prefix.  The special group :all refers to all groups.  A name prepended
by a caret will exclude that selection.

    $ judo restart myserver1                ## this restarts myserver1
    $ judo restart myserver1 myserver2      ## this restarts myserver1 and myserver2
    $ judo restart :default                 ## this restarts all servers in the :default group
    $ judo restart myserver1 :default :db   ## this restarts all servers in the :default group, the :db group, and a server named myserver1
    $ judo restart :all                     ## this restarts all servers in all groups
    $ judo restart :default ^myserver3      ## this restarts all servers in the default group except myserver3
    $ judo restart :all ^:default           ## this restarts all servers except those in the default group

Server: Judo does not track EC2 instances, but Servers, which are a collection
of state, such as EBS volumes, elastic IP addresses and a current EC2 instance
ID.  This allows you to abstract all the elastic EC2 concepts into a more
traditional concept of a static Server.

##	STARTING

You will need an AWS account with EC2, S3 and SDB all enabled.

Setting up a new judo repo named "my_cloud" would look like this:

    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
    $ mkdir my_cloud
    $ cd my_cloud
    $ judo generate
    $ judo commit :default

The `judo generate` command will make a folder named "default" to hold the default server
config.  Feel free to examine the default folder.  It consists of some example
files for a simple server.

The `judo commit` command will upload the default group configuration to AWS so that
it can be used. You'll need to commit every time you make a change to your group config.

To launch a default server you create it

    $ judo create :default            ## make one :default server - have judo pick the name
    ---> Creating server default1...     done (0.6s)
    $ judo create 2:default           ## make two :default servers - have judo pick the name
    ---> Creating server default2...     done (0.5s)
    ---> Creating server default3...     done (0.7s)
    $ judo create myserver1:default   ## make one :default server named myserver1
    ---> Creating server myserver1...    done (0.6s)
    $ judo list
      SERVERS
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      default1             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      default2             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      default3             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      myserver1            default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
    $ judo start myserver1
    ---> Starting server myserver1...    done (2.3s)
    $ judo launch myserver2:default   ## launch does a create and a start in 1 step
    ---> Creating server myserver2...    done (0.6s)
    ---> Starting server myserver2...    done (2.9s)
    $ judo list
      SERVERS
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      default1             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      default2             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      default3             default      v1             m1.small               ebs:0
      myserver1            default      v1 i-6fdf8d09  m1.small    running    ebs:0
      myserver2            default      v1 i-49cef122  m1.small    running    ebs:0

You can examine a groups config by looking in the group folder in the repo.  The
default group will look something like this.

    $ cat default/config.json
    {
        "ami32":"ami-2d4aa444",       // public ubuntu 10.04 ami - 32 bit
        "ami64":"ami-fd4aa494",       // public ubuntu 10.04 ami - 64 bit
        "user":"ubuntu",              // this is for ssh acccess - defaults to ubuntu not root
        "kuzushi_version": "0.0.54",  // this will pin the version of kuzushi the server will boot with
        "security_group":"judo",
        "example_config": "example_mode",
        "availability_zone":"us-east-1d"
    }

Any changes you make to these files do not stick until you've committed them.
To commit a group do the following.

    $ judo commit :default
    Compiling version 2... done (1.2s)

This will create and start two servers.  One named 'myserver1' and one named
'myserver2'.  You can ssh into 'myserver1' you can type:

    $ judo ssh myserver1

You can stop all the servers in the :default group with:

    $ judo stop :default

## EXAMPLES

An example is worth a thousand words.

A couchdb server:

### ./couchdb/config.json

    {
        "ami32":"ami-2d4aa444",       // public ubuntu 10.04 ami - 32 bit
        "ami64":"ami-fd4aa494",       // public ubuntu 10.04 ami - 64 bit
        "user":"ubuntu",              // this is for ssh acccess - defaults to ubuntu not root
        "security_group":"judo",
        "availability_zone":"us-east-1d"
        "elastic_ip" : true,
        "packages" : "couchdb",
        "volumes" : { "device" : "/dev/sde1",
                      "media"  : "ebs",
                      "size"   : 64,
                      "format" : "ext3",
                      // this is where couchdb looks for its data by default
                      "mount"  : "/var/lib/couchdb/0.10.0",
                      "user"   : "couchdb",
                      "group"  : "couchdb" }
                      // make sure the data is owned by the couchdb user
                      // bounce couch since the data dir changed
    }

### ./couchdb/setup.sh

    service couchdb restart

        "elastic_ip" : true,
        "instance_type" : "m1.xlarge"
    }

    service memcached start

### ./memcache/memcached.conf.erb

    -d

    -m <%= (@system.memory["total"].to_i / 1024 * 0.75).to_i %>
    -u nobody

A redis server with a 2 disk xfs raid 0:

### ./redis/config.json

    {
        "ami32":"ami-2d4aa444",       // public ubuntu 10.04 ami - 32 bit

                      "format"    : "xfs" }]
    }

### ./redis/redis-server_1.2.6-1_i686.deb

    ## the deb package can be included the the folder and pushed to the server

### ./redis/setup.sh

    dpkg -i redis-server_1.2.6-1_i686.deb
    chown redis:redis -R /var/lib/redis
    service redis restart

## CONFIG - LAUNCHING THE SERVER

    "instance_type":"m1.small",

Specify the instance type for the server type here. See:
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/.  If nothing is specified m1.small is
used.

   "ami32":"ami-2d4aa444",
   "ami64":"ami-fd4aa494",
   "user":"ubuntu",

This is where you specify the AMI's to use.  The defaults (above) are the
ubuntu 10.04 public AMI's.  The "user" value is which user has the keypair
bound to it for ssh'ing into the server.

    "security_group":"judo",

What security group to launch the server in.  A judo group is created for you
which only has port 22 access.  Manually create new security groups as needed
and name them here.

    "availability_zone":"us-east-1d"

What zone to launch the server in.

    "elastic_ip" : true,

If this is true, an elastic IP will be allocated for the server when it is
created.  This means that if the server is rebooted it will keep the same IP
address.

    "volumes" : [ { "device" : "/dev/sde1", "media" : "ebs", "size" : 64 } ],

You can specify one or more volumes for the group.  If the media is of type
"ebs" judo will create an elastic block device with a number of gigabytes
specified under size.  AWS currently allows values from 1 to 1000.  If the
media is anything other than "ebs" judo will ignore the entry.  The EBS drives
are tied to the server and attached as the specified device when started.  Only
when the server is destroyed are the EBS drives deleted.
