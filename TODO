* Fix issue where first ssh takes ages (dns?)

* Race condition:
---> Starting server soccer-app-ci... /Users/mpearson/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/aws-2.4.2/lib/awsbase/awsbase.rb:540:in `request_info_impl': InvalidInstanceID.NotFound: The instance ID 'i-01ea796d' does not exist (Aws::AwsError)

  Worked around with a sleep 1 after starting the instance and before tagging.

* scp support

* ssh command support ("judo ssh my_instance sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart")

* Port to bundler

* Port to clamp

* Some native way of juggling multiple accounts
  (maybe not - this is a use case specific to my workplace, and would probably harm the implemtation more than help)

* Region support
  either by config or by environment variable

* Look at fog instead of right_aws

* Unit tests

* Passing around @base is a broken model for accessing ec2 - move to a Singleton

* Warn on destroy if owner tag != ENV['USER']

* Attempt to make judo list output fit on a 80 column terminal (autoscale?)

* uninstall command (remove s3, sdb, not keypair unless forced)

* Er, did I add functionality that already exists with :default_instance_type? Check to see if :instance_type works (although I can't see it in the code)
  (no, I didn't - it doesn't work.)
  (then I should probably fix the docs)
  
* Simpledb or other information caching for those working on high-laency links (ie, us plebs in Australia)

* Centralized region support: store everything in one SDB (region specified by environment, eg I'd have it in ap-southeast-1),
  track instances in many regions.
